        <h2>About the Mental Health Chatbot</h2>
        <p>
            The Mental Health Chatbot is an AI-powered tool designed to provide emotional support, mental health
            resources, and guidance.
            Whether you're feeling stressed, anxious, or just need someone to talk to, our chatbot is here to help. It
            offers a safe and
            confidential space to express your feelings, learn coping strategies, and connect with professional
            resources. Our goal is to
            make mental health support accessible to everyone, anytime, anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mental health is just as important as physical health, and we believe that everyone deserves access to the
            tools and support
            they need to thrive. Our chatbot is not a replacement for professional therapy, but it can be a helpful
            companion on your
            journey toward better mental well-being.
